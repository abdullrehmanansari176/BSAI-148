# Data Processing Project

## Student Information
**Name:** [Abdull Rehman]  
**Roll No:** [F24-148]  
**Section:** [BSAI-1C]  
**Subject:** [Proramming Fundamental]
**Project:** [Heart Disease]  

## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing and processing healthcare data from the **"cleveland2.csv"** dataset. The dataset includes **302 rows and 15 columns** of data related to individuals' heart health, such as age, cholesterol levels, chest pain types, and other clinical measurements.

The primary objectives are to clean, preprocess, and analyze the data to extract meaningful insights and trends related to cardiovascular health. The project employs **Python's pandas library** for data manipulation and exploratory analysis.

### Features of the Dataset:
- **Attributes:** Includes columns like "age," "sex," "cholesterol levels," and "target," which indicates heart disease presence.  
- **Insights Derived:**
  - Average age of individuals: ~54 years.
  - Distribution of chest pain types, cholesterol levels, and more.  
  - Relationships between clinical metrics and the likelihood of heart disease.

## Goals of the Project
1. Clean and preprocess the dataset (e.g., rename columns, handle missing values).  
2. Derive statistical summaries such as mean, median, and mode for critical variables.  
3. Visualize trends in data using graphs like histograms and bar charts.  
4. Group and analyze specific attributes (e.g., by age group or gender) for deeper insights.

## Key Points
- Data cleansing includes handling column names and missing values.
- Statistical analysis includes measures like:
  - Mean chest pain type: 0.96
  - Median resting blood pressure: 130 mmHg
- Created new features such as `final_age` to fill missing age values.

## Future Enhancements
- Build predictive models to classify heart disease risk based on input variables.
- Explore advanced visualizations to present findings interactively.
- Apply feature engineering for better interpretation of key metrics.
